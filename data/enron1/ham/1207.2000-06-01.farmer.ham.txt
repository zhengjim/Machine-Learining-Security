bob ,
go ahead and accept the nom revision . i believe that this is with pge , not
el paso . how do the rest of our noms compare with eog ? i f they have a
higher volume at another meter than we do , i would like to increase our nom
there . in effect , i want to keep our physical index position as close as
possible to what we have in the system now .

charlotte hawkins is having trouble confirming the volume of 5 , 733 with el
paso . el paso will not confirm the volume that high . eog revised their
nomination as follows :
c / p name meter # orig nom rev nom
eog res . 6296 5 , 733 2 , 300
will you approve revising the volume in unify down to 2 , 300 ? please advise .
