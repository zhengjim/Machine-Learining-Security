i have a price discrepancy with one of stacey ' s deals with texaco natural gas for april 2001 . it is deal 695976 for 12 , 000 / day . we have it priced at waha gas daily + 0 . 005 and texaco says it should be waha if + 0 . 005 . rick o ' bannion , the trader at texaco , has confirmed their price . can you check this for me and let me know which is correct ?
