scotty / richard ,
our dbas would like to see what we can do to reduce the qty of rows in
contract _ event _ status . we have over 1 gig of data in that table . i would
like to suggest we have a nightly or weekly or monthly process to delete any
row with a last _ mod _ date over a month ( or two ) old . so if someone balances
february 1999 this month , we will keep it around for a month ( or two ) .
does any one else have a desire to keep this data for a shorter / longer period
of time ?
this is not an audit table . this is just a " log " every nom / track / balance / edi
send / fax send / sched qty / quick response since the beginning of time .
