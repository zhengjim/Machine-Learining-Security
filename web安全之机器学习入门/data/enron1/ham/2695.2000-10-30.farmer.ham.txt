Subject: october deals
daren ,
i have 2 allocation exceptions that require a deal to be extended . meter
98 - 1488 tenaska is showing small volumes flowed on days there was no deal .
can you extend the deal throughout the month so that the volumes will have a
deal to link to . i have the same situation on meter 98 - 1601 .
if you have any questions , please let me know .
thanks ,
susan
