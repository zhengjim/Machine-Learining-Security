i do not have a record of a spot deal in my notes or my deal sheet . if bob wants to call me with a tape that would be great . the . 085 difference results in $ 405 so i will call bob and try to put this to bed . as of now leave it allocated to a term deal .

a volume of 6 , 289 mmbtu flowed over the noms for cp & l . i don ' t have a record of a spot deal with them for that day .
gary - currently , that volume has been allocated to the term agreement . the price difference on that day is significant . ( hsc gd mid was 5 . 245 ) . if you don ' t have a record of a spot deal , the allocation should stand as it is .

can we verified this gas flowed ? if it did it should have been billed on his term deal if there was one in place . if the gas flowed and we did not invoice for it on term let me know and i will put it in .
