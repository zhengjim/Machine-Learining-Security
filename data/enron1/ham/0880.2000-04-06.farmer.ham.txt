Subject: 98 - 1600 & 98 - 6725 needing k ' s
daren ,
i hate to be a pest but here ' s the deal on the above two meters :
98 - 1600 sitara deal # 159194 expired on 2 / 29 / 2000 . the flow for 2 / 2000 was
on the 215 k . this meter ( del . ) flowed 53 . 863 for 3 / 2000 . there is no new
deal referenced , nor is the evergreen flag in effect .
98 - 6725 sitara deal # 214948 expired 3 / 27 / 2000 . no evergreen and no new deal
referenced . this is a little premature but this meter is active monthly
and i ' m thinking that it will flow for this month with no k being applied .
thanks
