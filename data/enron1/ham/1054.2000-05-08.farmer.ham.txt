Subject: ena sales on hpl
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !
thanks in advance .
