txu revised their rates for jan 2001 . they are now billing us at $ 0 . 10 and
$ 0 . 08 for contract 1671 . this was previously billed all at $ 0 . 10 . please
change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $ 3 , 841 , 888 . 11 to $ 3 , 830 , 131 . 18 .
also , i spoke to txu about the rate on contract 1856 ( deal 452475 ) . they
have been billing us $ 0 . 11 and we have $ 0 . 10 . the extra cent is for the el
paso header fee . the pricing you gave me is for contract 1671 , but also has
the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6 . you ' ll see a a section called
" compression & header expense if utilized " . the current rate for 1856 is
$ 0 . 01 and 0 % fuel . i will leave a copy of the contract in your chair .
thanks ,

we need to change the demand fees for tenaska iv based on actuals for jan
2001 . tenaska owes us some additional money . i have attached my netting
spreadsheet if you need it .
deal 514353 change mmbtu from 45 , 000 to 46 , 113
deal 384258 change amount from $ 3 , 934 , 644 . 50 to $ 3 , 841 , 888 . 11
i got your message regarding apache . i will just leave the pay the lesser
ofs there until they come back for it . also , mark checked with txu and we
do not have the rights to get dailies for the tenaska meters . he said that
only the interconnecting pipes get dailies . for the spreadsheet , i am just
going to prorate the actuals based on the noms .
i will let you know when we receive the payment from brazos for feb 2001 , so
you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to tenaska iv .
thanks ,
megan
