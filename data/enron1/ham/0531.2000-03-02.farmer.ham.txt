the rates are in the system correctly in unify ( so that we can invoice
correctly ) , but daren ' s group uses a sitara deal ( the transport usage
tickets ) to estimate desk transport in the p & l during the month . right now
we have not entered in or corrected rates in their transport usage tickets .
our group has not taken that step , since we have been most concerned with
settling the g / l ( after the month is over ) . by not having the right rates on
the transport usage tickets , the risk is that the p & l will be off during the
month . would we change process and let daren set up the transport usage
ticket and then have us enter the rate ? if so , we would need to change the
process with his group to put us in the process so that we can enter the
correct rate . please let me know what you want to do .

heidi , we need to ensure the rates are correct on all meters ( hplc / ena for
texas ) and that the rates are in the right system .

fyi . . . the economics group publishes this report every month to show how much
the marketing desk spent in transport . they can get their expense numbers
either from their estimate ( from cpr ) or from unify , where we put the rates
in .
one potential enhancement would be that in addition to managing rates for the
transport capacity tickets , we set up the rates for the transport usage
tickets . i am going through the transport usage tickets for february right
now ( as part of the market meter study ) and i see some rates i don ' t tie back
to lauri ' s matrix . for example , lauri ' s matrix shows 0 . 05 from thompsonville
to hsc , but the transport usage ticket ( updated by daren ' s group ) has 0 . 055 .
this means the economic estimate can be off . let me know what you want to do
with this .
