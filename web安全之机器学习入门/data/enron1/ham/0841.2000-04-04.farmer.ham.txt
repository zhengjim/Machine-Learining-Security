Subject: issues with measurement ( gary anderson ' s group )
it seems to me that there have been several issues recently involving data
feeds from measurement . regardless of the issue , you all seem to express the
same concern : a lack of accountability , no sense of urgency . . . . .
i brought this up in brian ' s staff meeting yesterday , in hopes to get some
ideas on where to go to get some results . rita , i understaood from you that
gary has returned your call and you are setting a meeting for later this
week . please include me in the meeting . if we don ' t get what we need , it
was recommended that i talk with ellis sturn . if that doesn ' t work , brian
will talk with rod hayslett . rita : prior to the meeting , would you please
coordinate the meeting and agenda , consolidating all issues / concerns ? yvette
can set the meeting .
