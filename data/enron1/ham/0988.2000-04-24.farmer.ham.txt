Subject: meter # 1591 lamay gaslift
daren - meter 1591 has never flowed the entire nom . this meter is has been
over nominated . it has had a nom of 1 . 000 / day ( 429 . 000 total mmbtus ) since
1 / 28 / 99 and has flowed only 11 . 692 . am i correct to say that this meter
needs a lower nom ? please let me know if i should look out for a lower nom
in may . pat seems to think this may be affecting the p / l for april . we only
have estimates / actuals of zero on 4 / 1 & 4 / 2 .
please let me know if this makes sense .

flow and the
bav is showing the nom volume . this could be adversely affecting the risk
numbers . pat
