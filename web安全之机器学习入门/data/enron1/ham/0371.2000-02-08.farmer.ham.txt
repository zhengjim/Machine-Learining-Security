Subject: gary ,
could you please remove scada / mips from the following hpl meters . these
meters are where mid - texas interconnects with
pg & e ' s system , and there should not be any measurement taking place on hpl .
these meters were set up originally when we thought
that every meter on mid - texas should automatically have a corresponding meter
on hpl . this assumption is now incorecct .
