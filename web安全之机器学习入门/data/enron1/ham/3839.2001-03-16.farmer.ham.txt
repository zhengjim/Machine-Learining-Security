Subject: bayer - march 2001 volumes
just want to make sure volumes are allocated to two different tickets
correctly for march :
sitara - 572910 - gets 50 , 000 mmbtu total for the month . . . . after 50 , 000 on
this ticket , all remaining volumes go to . . .
sitara 643510 - the swing ticket
thanks
