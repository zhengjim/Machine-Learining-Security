Subject: re : cannon interest may 2000 purchase
hi daren ,
i received an email from kenny soignet to make sure everything was in the
system for me to pay cannon on friday , 5 / 19 / 00 .
the deal # is 257141 . i see that the volume has not been scheduled , so
therefore it is not pulling into unify for me to pay .
are you the person that will be able to schedule the volume in order for me
to pull up this deal ?
( i see that in sitara that the deal is set for 5 / 00 production , does that
matter ? )
thanks , stephanie ( 3 - 6004 )
