phillips said we shorted them gas on december lst so they pulled it on
january 1 . can we verify that we did not deliver 5 , 00 on dec . 1 ? if that is
the case and this was a firm sale , we owe him some gas at dec index less
( . 045 ) . which is bad ! let me know what happened in dec before i can put
this deal out in jan .
