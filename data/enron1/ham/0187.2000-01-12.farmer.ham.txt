for days 4 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 , 17 and 28 , we are short at the aggregate
meter . should the reliant transport and sales or do we charge reliant a
penalty ?
also , i notice that at meter 1554 we have 3 rd party transport this month .
this look strange because i ' ve not seen them here before .
please advice .
thanks
