Subject: loan from midcon at katy tailgate
fyi -
i spoke with patsy , per daren ' s request , regarding a swap with midcon texas .
patsy agreed to lend us the gas we need at the meter , rather that swap with
us . the net effect , after they pay back what hpl parked on them , according
to patsy , is a lend of 12 , 276 mmbtu ' s . mtp is going to confirm an addition
16 , 903 total to hpl . please let me know if you have any questions .
