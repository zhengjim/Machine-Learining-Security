Subject: life in general
good god - - - - where do you find time for all of that . you should write a book when the kids go off to college . by then you should have many many stories .
by the way what is your new address ? i may want to come by some evening with a lawn chair and a 6 pack . watching you work sounds better than anything on tv .
you will make a good trader . good relationships and flexible pricing are all you need . oh , and a few zillion other intangibles you will run into . it beats the hell out of most other things though .
i ' ll let you be for now , but do keep those stories coming - - - - we love them .
