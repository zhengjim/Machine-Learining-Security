subject : re : industrial report
i am completing the last of 3 - worksheets { 1 - julie m . & 2 - ken s . } today and
will distribute them once i finish .
sorry for the delay but various office julie meyers file or ken
seaman file ?
both files provide similar data which is helpful to all of our support
groups .
to prepare both files i feel is a duplicate of my efforts . please let
know if you want both files updated
and the approximate time table for completion .
