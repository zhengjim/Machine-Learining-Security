i ' m assuming that since this deal is on the new texas desk , and that no new deals have been negotiated under ces counterparties that this deal is actually a truncated deal that was split to move open production from ena - im texas ( which i believe no longer exists as part of the post - hpl / aep processes ) to ena - im lonestar . the deals have been split several times anderson , bridgette ; campos , anthony ; gonzales , sharon

i was researching deal 819348 ( ces - midcon texas gas services corp ) and found that it was incorrectly attached to contract 96035432 ( in fact , the gtc firm had three deals attached ) . since one of the deals ended 03 / 31 / 01 , we won ' t bother correcting that one , but this deal needs to be moved . i set up contract 96061912 and attached it today . this deal still needs to be reviewed by cyndie before the cp is inactivated .
elizabeth , could you please revalidate this deal ?
my team , could you please add this one to your daily deal count report ?
ellen , could you please reconfirm if necessary ?
thanks , all . please let me know if you have any questions .
