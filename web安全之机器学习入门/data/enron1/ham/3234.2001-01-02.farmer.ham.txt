Subject: bowl games
hi ,
?
am i to understand that not a single team in my adopted state won a bowl
game ?

pissed off about not playing in a better bowl . we need more meat than the
big 10 can throw out .
?
well now it is down to next year again . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
?
did cole get enough trucks from santa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . or did jake eat
them ? i ' m sure it was fun .
