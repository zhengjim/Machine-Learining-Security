Subject: cilco
per our conversation , the months relating to the cilco deal with ena - texas
are may 1999 - sept 1999 .
however , when howard and i talked about correcting the allocation in pops ,
howard is telling me that the cilco sale is tied to the transport ( 206 )
contract in pops . if we remove the sale b / t ena - tx and cilco and put the
sale b / t ena - tx and the storage book , we no longer have a sale to tie to the
transport . let me know what you think as we did not discuss this .
thanks !
