i suffered from poor sperm count and motility . i found
your site and ordered spur - m fertility blend for men .
i have wondered for years what caused low semen and sperm
count , and how i could improve my fertility and help my wife
conceive . spur - m seems to have done just that ! thank you

i had been wondering on the causes of low semen and
sperm count , i was searching for this type of information
when i found your site . i hadn ' t been made aware of this
product before then , so was quite surprised to be able
to find a male fertility product . usually everything is
geared towards female fertility . suffice to say i ordered
and a few months later we received the good news from the
doctors - my wife is pregnant . i can ' t be 100 % sure if
it was spur - m that helped . but i am happy enough to be able
to say it should be considered by any man looking to increase
his fertility . it worked for me . thanks .
