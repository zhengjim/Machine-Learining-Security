Subject: southern union
i combined the tickets for the southern union plants at port arthur and
galveston for april forward to accurately reflect the contract . the new
sitara number is 224490 , and the old numbers are : 17832 andl 09216 . this
change will allow for a more accurate estimate in our p & l as well as more
accurate invoicing . i believe that this change will reduce our monthly
variances due to these deals . if you have any questions or concerns please
feel free to give me a call
