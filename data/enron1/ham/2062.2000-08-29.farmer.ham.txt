should these not be converted to ena - im texas ? ? ? some time ago - we were
told this desk was dead and the existing deals would end . this desk is not
included in any texas desk portfolios .
the ect desks are supposed to be inactive - however - these deals keep
rolling - and
someone created some new ones ? if the desk is active - should we change it
to ena - im waha -
as ect is no more ? ? ?
