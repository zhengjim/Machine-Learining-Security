comments on substance of the letter ( please review carefully my reference to
what ena is acting as agent for - - it is specific as to noms , scheduling and
billing , not a general agency for all things under the contract - - is that
correct ? )
if you don ' t mind , please forward any email response to bob walker and leave
me a voicemail . i will be out of the office friday , but checking voicemail
and coordianting with bob to get these out .
also , once we send these letters out , we should be prepared for each of these
entities to ask to see the agency agreement . they may , in fact , not be
comfortable dealing with ena with just this letter .
