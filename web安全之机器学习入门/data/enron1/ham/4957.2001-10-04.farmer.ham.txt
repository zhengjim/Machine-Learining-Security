bryant gumbel recently interviewed billy graham ' s daughter .
gumbel : " why didn ' t god stop this or do something about this ? "
billy graham ' s daughter : " for years we have told god we didn ' t want
him in our schools . we didn ' t want him in our government and we
didn ' t want him in our finances and god was being a perfect gentleman in
doing just what we asked him to do . we need to make up our mind - do
we want god or do we not want him . we cannot just ask him in when
disaster strikes . "
