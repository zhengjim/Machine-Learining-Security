Subject: re : free agents
send me a request of who you want , and i will make the transaction this
evening . . . expecting that no one ahead of you in the waiver ranking makes a
bid for the same person . the new player will be available for this weekend
( assuming the games are on ! ) , and you will be dropped to the bottom of the
waiver ranking system . remember , you can only pick up 2 per week . get back
to me when you want !
