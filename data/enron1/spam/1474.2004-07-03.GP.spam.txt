Subject: please update your account details with citibank
dear citibank customer ,
we recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your citibank
account from a foreign ip address and we have reasons to believe that
there was attempts to compromise it with brute forcing your pin number .
no successful login was detected and you have full protection by now .
if you recently accessed your account while travelling , the unusual login
attempts may have been initiated by you .
the login attempt was made from :
ip address : 173 . 27 . 187 . 24
isp host : cache - 82 . proxyserver . cis . com
by now , we used many techniques to verify the accuracy of the
information our users provide us when they register on the site .
however , because user verification on the internet is difficult , citibank
cannot and does not confirm each user ' s purported identity . thus , we
have established an offline verification system to help you evaluate with
whom you are dealing with . the system is called citisafe and it ' s
the most secure citibank wallet so far .
if you are the rightful holder of the account , click the link bellow , fill
the form and then submit as we will verify your identity and register you
to citisafe free of charge . this way you are fully protected from fraudulent
activity on all the accounts that you have with us .
click to protect
yourself from fraudulent activity !
to make citibank . com the most secure site , every user will be
registered to citisafe .
note ! if you choose to ignore our request , you leave us no choice but to
temporally suspend your account .
* please do not respond to this e - mail , as your reply will not be received .
regards , citibank customer support
