daren ,
i know it ' s first of the month but the above meter has flow for 3 / 15 ( 71
dec . ) and 3 / 23 ( 35 dec . ) but the deal ( sitara # 213005 ) doesn ' t cover these
two days .
can you see if it is feasible to activate these two days in sitara so that i
can clear my exceptions for volume management ?
thanks
