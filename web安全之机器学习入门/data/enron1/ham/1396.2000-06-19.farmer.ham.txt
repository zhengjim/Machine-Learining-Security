subject : 6 / 15 / 00 revision to sea robin volumes
christina ,
the attached shows the volumes that should have been nominated effective
6 / 15 / 00 and 6 / 16 / 00 . the sea robin plant was back up for those two days and
gas was processed resulting in a decrease for pvr . effective 6 / 17 / 00 , the
plant was down again and volumes were increased to reflect no processing
loss . i forwarded those volumes to you on friday , june 16 .
let me know of any questions you have .
thanks ,
steve
