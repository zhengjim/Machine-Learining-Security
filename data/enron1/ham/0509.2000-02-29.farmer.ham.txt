Subject: february surveys
hello ,
we are starting to prepare the february data for our model . please provide a
completed " hours " survey for each position within your group . this survey
will collect the the time your team spent on performing their activities in
the month of february .
at the top of the spreadsheet , you will see a box labeled " select your rc " .
click on the box and input your rc number , which will need to be 4 digits .
once you have done this , another box will appear with the message " select
position from drop box ! " you can then select the position ( i . e . , staff ,
specialist , etc . ) and " ok " . the choices for positions are based on
information contained in the org database ( i . e . , if a position is not listed
that should be , please call me to discuss as it would indicate that
corrections need to be made to the database ) . once you have the list of
activities , please input hours ( for the entire month ) for each activity
listed in the column labeled " hours " .
if you ' re filling out the survey for your team , save a file for each of the
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position .
if you do not , the information will be lost .
we have included january compiled hours per position ( if you had two
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each , the " last month "
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month ) . as with last month , you
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send
this survey to each of your team members , allowing each individual to fill
out the time they spent on each activity . if there are any activities you
perform not included in your survey , please contact me as soon as possible
for a copy of the activity dictionary .
please return these surveys by end of day friday , march 3 rd . if this is a
problem , please notify immediately .
thanks ,
shari
