subject : wholesale volumes - august
it ' s that time again for the monthly and quarterly volumetric explanations !
the database for august is now ready for viewing . just as a reminder , this
is the shortcut on your desktop called " statistical database " .
as there is continued investor focus on our wholesale operations , investor
relations requests that business analysis & reporting provide monthly
volumetric analysis for wholesale operations in addition to the quarterly
analysis . please review the analysis for august 2000 and provide
explanations for all material changes ( + / - 10 % ) for the year / year ,
quarter / quarter , and month / month variances . the current objective of
investor relations is to use this analysis as a resource to answer potential
investor or analyst questions , but it may be used for ad hoc requests and
presentations . it is essential that the volumes be verified by commercial
personnel .
please forward your verification and explanations via e - mail to me by 10 : 00 am
friday , september 22 . please feel free to call with any questions .
thanks ,
misti
