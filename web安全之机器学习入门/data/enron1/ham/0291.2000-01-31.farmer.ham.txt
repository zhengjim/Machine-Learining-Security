Subject: winter cap for entex
when you get allocations for january , we need to look at daily volumes for
transaction # 1 . towards the end of the month , entex was approaching its jan
winter cap volume of 550 , 000 / day . if the daily volume for trans # 1 comes out
greater than 550 , the excess must be charged at gd + 10 . the numbers thus far
show that they did not exceed 550 . however , the allocated volumes tend to
differ .
thanks ,
