i got an invoice for the gas we bought from apache for tenaska iv and they
have a different price . for deal 384247 , we have a price of 2 . 285 and a
demand fee of 0 . 457 for 25 , 000 / day . apache is billing us at 2 . 175 with no
demand charge . can you verify this price for me and let me know which is
correct ?
thanks ,
megan
