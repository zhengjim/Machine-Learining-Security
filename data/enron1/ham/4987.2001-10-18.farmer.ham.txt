Subject: blue dolpin / august and september 2001
darren ,
i received another invoice for september production for blue dolphin . are we responsible for transportation fees for september and future production months ? also , do the dehydration fees ( mei ) apply to aep as well ? currently , the august invoices have not been paid . if ena upstream is not responsible , let me know who / where i should forward the invoices .
