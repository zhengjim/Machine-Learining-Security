Subject: sale of hpl
to all :
the proposed sale of hpl to american electric power ( aep ) has been signed and
the conditions for the acquisition should be completed within the coming
months . over the next few days , i will be forwarding more details about the
transition process . these details will outline the employment opportunities
and transfer process to aep . aep is eager to complete these arrangements ,
as the pipeline is only as valuable as the people who operate it .
during the transition period , it is important that we keep the pipe line
operating at our historical level of reliability in order to meet the energy
needs of our customers .
regards ,
brian
