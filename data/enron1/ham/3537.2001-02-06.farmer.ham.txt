i just have to brag on myself as my game seldom affords me the opportunity .
sunday after church , tom knox and i played 18 holes at mimosa . the weather
was perfect . while my game stunk overall ( 118 ) , i did manage par on one par
3 and two par 5 ' s . the best was at 14 - - - a 545 yard par 5 . my drive was
280 yards ( the ground was flat ! ) . i was on the green three feet from the
pin in 3 , and then two - putted . those three pars however will keep me going
back . remember , i had a witness !
thanks for listening to me brag . and no , don ' t expect me to replicate these
feats on our next outing . hope all are doing well . we ' re remembering
rachel and jake in our prayers each day .
