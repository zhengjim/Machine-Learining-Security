Subject: prom dress shopping
hi , just wanted to let you know that lacy ' s sugar levels are staying up
pretty well . she was down to 51 this morning , but she took a shot last night
& i guess she didn ' t eat enough ice cream . she was mad at me cause i didn ' t
give her more than i did . but it ' s so hard to know exactly how to handle it
' cause she ' s been going to bed a little high & getting up a little high . but
anyway , she ' s doing better & i guess she ' ll always be mad & think i ' m
mistreating her . i stay stressed out every day not knowing if she got low
after i left & passed out & no one would know it . i ' m going to try to get a
cell phone & have her call me when she gets there - - i think - - i don ' t
know - - she ' ll be mad about that too . but the other night , she didn ' t eat
right after she took her shot , then didn ' t eat anything fast acting & got in
the truck to go over to phillip ' s to get research info from his computer , got
low & had to pull over & eat sugar tabs . so that ' s what scares me . she knew
to eat righ !
t after she took that shot & didn ' t . but she was high before she took it & i
guess she didn ' t think about it getting low . i don ' t know what will happen to
her when she leaves home .
but anyway , i wanted to let you know that we ' re going to dallas to look for
the prom dress & shoes , don ' t know if we will stay all night or not . i
haven ' t talked to shane & shelley . i wanted to stay & go to saturn rd . to
church & go to the singles class . but i don ' t know what shane & shelley have
planned . so we ' ll be back either sat . night or sun . lacy has to be back to
work on 3 research papers & projects that are all due at once . so , wish us
luck . any donations will be appreciated ! i hear they ' re more than i was
expecting . but anyway , i don ' t intend to go overboard . maybe there will be
some sales .
hope my grandsons are doing ok . i bet they were glad that their daddy got
back home sunday . hug them for me & tell cole that mimi can ' t wait to see his
bunkbeds . love ya ' ll
