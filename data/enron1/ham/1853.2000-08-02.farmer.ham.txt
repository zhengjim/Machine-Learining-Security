Subject: resolved issue : re : meter # 0986563 -
fyi -
it apppears that any deliveries made during the time frame from 12 / 99 -
04 / 02 / 00 , were made without any contractual arrangements for purchase .
therefore , vance explained to me that the volume of 1 , 517 dth for the period
should have been allocated to the strangers agreement , just as it was . any
deliveries were unauthorized ( udog ) and the gas then belongs to hpl . please
give vance a call if you have any further questions regarding this issue .
thank you all for your patience and assistance . i appreciate it !
