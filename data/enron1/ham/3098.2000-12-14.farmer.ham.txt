Subject: hpl meter # 985579
gary :
hpl received volumes at the above meter during 1 / 1 / 99 thru 6 / 99 . prior to
1 / 1 / 99 , ena was purchasing some of the volumes from i p petroleum under
contract # 016 - 44386 - 102 ; deal # 341832 . this deal expired 12 / 31 / 99 , but the
volumes continued to flow and be allocated to i p petroleum by pioneer .
since there was no deal to cover these volumes , these volumes were allocated
to hpl strangers gas contract .
volume mgmt had previously requested a deal to cover these volumes from
someone , but never received one .
here are the months and volumes that need resolution :
prod . mth mmbtus
jan . 99 6 , 510
feb . 99 6 , 395
mar . 99 14 , 789
apr . 99 16 , 866
may . 99 8 , 415
jun . 99 13 , 858
total 66 , 833
possible solution :
1 . need a deal to cover the periods in question , or
2 . provide authorization to writeoff the volumes . ( print & return original
to clem cernosek )
approval to writeoff the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
ps : my understanding is that neither i p petroleum nor pioneer have
addressed any issues concerning these volumes .
