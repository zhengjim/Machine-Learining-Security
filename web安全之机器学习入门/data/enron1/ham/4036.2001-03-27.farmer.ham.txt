Subject: windows 2000 and outlook
we will soon be migrating to windows 2000 and outlook . the texas desk is
scheduled for tuesday , april 10 th . i was told to pass along the following
information to my group :
1 . you will be receiving emails from the migration team ( " gem " ) - please be
sure to only open this from your own desktop , and not remotely . this is very
important . these messages will be explaining the migration process and what
you need to do to insure a successful migration .
2 . due to new space limitations on your mailbox , you are advised to clean
your notes mailbox of old , unneeded messages before migration . with outlook ,
you will be restricted to a mailbox size of 100 mb . outlook will issue a
warning once you reach 75 mb to let you know that you are near your mailbox
limit . once you reach 100 mb , you will be prevented from sending email , but
you will still be able to receive internal and external messages you will
then need to reduce the size of your mailbox by deleting old mail , saving
attachments to a local drive , etc . before you will be able to send an email
again .
3 . from the day of migration , only 30 days of old mail will be migrated from
your mailbox . this includes mail in your inbox and other folders . calendar
items dating back one year from the day of migration will be migrated .
4 . everyone will have a read only view of notes until the transition is
completed . you will be able to copy / paste .
thanks ,
laura
