i noticed the new october deals for valero ( 414065 , 414074 , 414071 ) include
both the base index pricing and the swing gas daily pricing . however , the
old swing deals ( 148386 , 148391 , 148382 ) are still valid through october .
should these deals be effective for october ?
thanks for your help .
