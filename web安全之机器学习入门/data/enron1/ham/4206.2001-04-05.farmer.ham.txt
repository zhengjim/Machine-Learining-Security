daren ,
according to vance ' s response to lauri ' s email , the nominations should be
revised upwards approximately 650 / d on the gathering contract ( s ) at this
meter . there is currently nominations of 1 , 353 / d ( 1 , 153 gathering and 200
transport ) . the flow should be around 2 , 000 / d . is it alright to include the
increase of 650 / d with the other revisions to be made after trading on friday ?

lauri ,
effective 3 / 1 / 2001 , hplc amended its contract with royal production changing
the price to 100 % hsc less $ 0 . 16 and extending the term through 2 / 28 / 02 .
consequently , for march , hplc should be purhasing volumes from two wells at
meter 5310 . effective april , hplc amended the same contract releasing the
l . g . talbert # 2 lease in the committed reserves agreement ; mike morris is the
gas buyer and expects volumes of approximately 2000 mmbtu / d . for april i nom
1132 / d ; bob , we should probably increase the nom to reflect the incremental
production at this point .
thanks ,

louis cox with copano ( the interconnecting party at this meter ) informed me
that effective march lst , we should have been buying incremental gas from
royal production at this point since they were no longer selling it to
copano . there have been no changes in the producer services noms at this
point , however . this point appears to be on a 14 day chart and the last flow
i have access to shows noms of 1332 mm with bav of 3497 mm on march 18 th .
bob / vance - could one of you guys check into this and see what the nom should
be ? copano says they ' re not getting the gas in april either , but they do not
know how long hplc is purchasing the incremental gas from royal . please let
me know what the resolution is . thanks .
