Subject: tenaska iv feb 2001
we do not have a demand fee for the feb 2001 tenaska iv sale , deal 384258 .
can you please put this in so i can bill ? from your spreadsheet , it looks
like it needs to be $ 2 , 291 , 888 . 83 , but you can verify . i subtracted the
agency fee from the tenaska iv receipt number , since we already have that
booked .
