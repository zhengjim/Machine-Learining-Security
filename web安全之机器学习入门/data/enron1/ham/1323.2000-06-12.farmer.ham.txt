subject : ec 254 , sp 13 and wc 45 ( 20 ) revisions
clarissa ,
per our conversation last week , we are unable to increase ec 254 , sp 13 and
wc 45 ( 20 ) due to the tennessee seal on the 800 leg . this shall confirm the
volumes will remain at first of the month levels until the seal is lifted .
at that time , i will recalculate the changes and notify you of any changes at
that time .
thanks ,
steve
