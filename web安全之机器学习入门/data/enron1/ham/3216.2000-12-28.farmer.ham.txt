Subject: mobil beaumont refinery
just wanted to thank everybody who works with mobil beaumont refinery .
our former three year deal with them expired september 30 . last week , we
( finally ) executed a new contract that keeps hpl as their largest natural gas
supplier through september 30 , 2002 . also , when their volumes go up in early
2001 , they will once again be hpl ' s single largest industrial customer .
everybody ' s hard work in keeping this customer happy has paid off . although
they can be very demanding to work with ( particularly now that they are part
of exxon ) , they know that hpl provides them the best overall service .
please pass on thanks to anyone i ' ve left off the list who has worked with
mobil beaumont refinery .
have a great 2001 .
