aimee :
please put the ena 201 contract at this meter for april and may of 1999 with
the track id 117848 and reallocate the meter for both months . after this is
done please let stephanie and i know so that she can redraft her invoice the
next day after pops bridges to mops . also with respect to the second issue
where daren is asking for the price , stephanie may be able to help you with
this because she has a copy of duke ' s invoice .
stephanie :
the crow o ' conner meter is essentially fixed . when aimee reallocates you
will have to wait until the next day to redraft your invoice . when aimee
gets back with us please redraft the invoice the next day and let me know if
this issue is resolved .
