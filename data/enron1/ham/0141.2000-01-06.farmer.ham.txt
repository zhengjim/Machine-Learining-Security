subject : re : request for application report list
last month richard burchfield sent us the following list of reports that are
available from ces ' s systems . it is working on a way to secure an electronic
copy of the required reports and making them available to us online via the
electronic document management system . while ena is not liable for pre - 2000
business , we may need to assist with research as issues arise . in order to
get the ball rolling , we need to get a list together of the reports we need .
please fill out the attached spreadsheet and list any reports that you need
and return it to me by friday , 1 / 15 / 2000 . if you do not want any reports ,
please send me an email letting me know that . i have included samples of how
to fill this out , and if you have any questions please give me a call .
if you aren ' t sure which reports you need based on the names , please get with
any ces employees you have hired or with a ces transition employee to get
clarification . if you need samples of any of these reports please let my
assistant , pam chambers , know and she will coordinate getting a sample report
printed for you .
in addition , i will need a list of the users and their logonid ' s who will
need to have access to this data . please send that to me by the 15 th as
well .
thanks , bryce

clay ,
i have had several requests from the ena business groups . now that the
agreement has been finalized , for report lists from your key applications ,
those
being , altra gms and risk works ( there may be others as people become more
aware ) . there will be a need for information for ena to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period . we feel this would be an easier process to
work
through if ena knows what kind of information they can request as we go
through
the transition .
thanks , richard
