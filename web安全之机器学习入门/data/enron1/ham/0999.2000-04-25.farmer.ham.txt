Subject: february 2000 production , pg & e discrepancy for 02 / 24 / 00 ( pan
energy exchange deal )
stacey -
as per my earlier voice mail messages , i needed to confirm what the actual
flow of gas was on pg & e for february 24 th . the service summary report from
pg & e indicated a flow of 50 , 000 mmbtus on the 24 th , however , the swamp rat
fuel allocations ( hpl ) indicates a flow of 53 , 000 mmbtus . can you ask pg & e
to confirm which of these volume is correct so that the february allocations
can be finalized ? please let me know if there is any additional information
i need to provide you .
thanks for your help -
