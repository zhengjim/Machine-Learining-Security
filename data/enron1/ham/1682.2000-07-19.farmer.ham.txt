pipeline to displace liquids on the saudi west coast .

rob ,
i got your name from doug leach . he thought that you would be the person to
talk to about this .
i got a call last night from rudolph maldonado . ( the operator forwarded him
our way . ) he stated that he has some natural gas to sell in saudi arabia .
his number is 562 - 866 - 1755 . could you give him a call and check this out ? i
told him that i would find someone that he could discuss this with .
i can be reached at 3 - 6905 if you have any questions .
