Subject: big thicket allocation
anita ,
after speaking with gary lamphier , big thicket ' s allocation for
pecos ' / roberson ' s portion will be done differently . historically , their
portion of the allocation was reduced for shrinkage . effective with october
00 ' s allocation , shrink will no longer be deducted . the full amount of
pecos / roberson ' s gas received at meter 6753 and delivered out at meter 8714
( vastar ) will be kept whole . i spoke with your contact harold mcgee at big
thicket and he spoke with pecos / roberson regarding this and everyone is
agreement . your allocation process will be done the same , however the
pecos / roberson number on the allocation statement will no longer have
shrinkage deducted . i have gone over the numbers for october with harold and
he has stated the 23 , 174 is the amount that will be allocated to
pecos / roberson , 946 will go to jay , and 9114 will be for enron ( this portion
has always been kept whole ) . can you please make sure that this is done . if
there are any questions , please let me know . thanks .
