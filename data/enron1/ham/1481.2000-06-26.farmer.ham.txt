Subject: re : cilco
there have been so many cilco issues until i ' m not sure which one you are
referencing . if it relates to the cilco sale that has created the large
receivable balance , then we are waiting on a response from daren . i met with
daren and kenny and we all agree that the sale between ena - tx and cilco is
invalid and that the sale has to be with the storage book ( your group will
not have to do anything with this sale ) . the problem lies in the associated
transport with that sale . this is the piece that we need daren ' s help on . i
will touch base with daren and see if we can get this resolved this week . if
this is not what you are referring to , please let me know . thanks !
