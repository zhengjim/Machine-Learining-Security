okay , this one has been resolved . . . . the deals for days 9 and 10 are good .
sitara did not feed this deal to mops at all therefore it didn ' t feed to
pops .
sherlyn is setting things up and will provide me with a tracking id , i will
enter volumes and re - allocate the meter .
very confusing but finally resolved .

charlotte ,
there is an interconnect variance at meter 980071 for 2 / 99 . it appears the
variance is created on 2 / 9 / 99 and 2 / 10 / 99 . there is a transport usage deal
ticket 72893 in sitara which shows pg & e delivers 6 , 965 mmbtu to hpl on 2 / 9 / 99
and 3 , 683 mmbtu on 2 / 10 / 99 , but hpl does not show a receipt of this volume .
let me know if you need the pg & e support .
