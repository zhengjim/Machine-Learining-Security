Subject: sanchez oil & gas - 20 , 000 / d , harris county , texas
daren , sanchez oil & gas has 3 wells ( their highlander wells ) connected to hpl at meter no . 98 - 9760 . these wells are flowing approx . 20 , 000 / d and sanchez would like to have a bid for the gas beginning december 1 for 1 year . their term will be up w / hpl then . can we get a transport bid from hpl to wherever you need the gas and i can buy it at receipt point less their transport or we can buy it at the meter . i know the rate will not be " pretty " , but there are other reasons sanchez may prefer to have enron buy their gas . let ' s discuss at your convenience . ( there is no rush now , buit i ' d like to be looking at it in the next month ) . thanks .
