subject : re : prc meeting agenda recap
the accomplishments by 6 / 19 is for directors and above - to sally .
individual groups under sally will probably set their deadlines prior to the
smaller prc ' s . that is correct .
i did not understand that promotions are to be discussed prior to the meeting
with sally our notes indicate that sally wanted some prior discussions on
this subject . nor did i understand that the employee had to be in their
role for 1 year . our notes indicate that this would be the general rule of
thumb . i thought the promotion discussion would be an agenda item of prc .
we believe that discussion of promotions will also occur at the prc .
additionally , i understood the mid - year promotion listing would not be as
extensive as year - end , maintaining the year - end as the primary promotion
time . we understood the same .

i think i ' m unclear on some points .
the accomplishments by 6 / 19 is for directors and above - to sally .
individual groups under sally will probably set their deadlines prior to the
smaller prc ' s .
i did not understand that promotions are to be discussed prior to the meeting
with sally nor did i understand that the employee had to be in their role for
1 year . i thought the promotion discussion would be an agenda item of
prc . additionally , i understood the mid - year promotion listing would not be
as extensive as year - end , maintaining the year - end as the primary promotion
time .
can you clarify ? thanks .
