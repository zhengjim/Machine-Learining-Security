Subject: entex adjustments for 5 / 00
i have reviewed the entex actuals and adjusted gas control ' s entex factor for
the month of may . i have found that entex estimates have been overstated by
approximately 10 . 0 mmcf / day .
romeo :
will you make sure the estimates that are in pops are corrected to reflect
the new volumes . this should help reduce some of the ua 4 that daren and pat
are trying to locate .
the attached file has the changes that need to be made . please let everyone
on this mailing list know once the changes have been made .
if you have any questions please call me at 36449 .
thanks
