yes , the dollar amount is what we need to recoup from williams . i will take the credit with our payment to williams on the 25 th . tenaska will send us their wire to us on the 24 th . i will make sure we receive the wire from tenaska before i send the wire to williams . i will also let james know about the volume for the agency fee . i thought it was suppose to be calculated on actual volume , not the nominated volume .

i have changed the demand fee . but , is this adjusted by the dollar amount that we need to recoup from williams ? i don ' t want to pay tenaska until we get the money from williams . additionally , i believe that we need to keep the volume at 45 , 000 for the admin fee , since we originally nominated 45 , 000 / day .
