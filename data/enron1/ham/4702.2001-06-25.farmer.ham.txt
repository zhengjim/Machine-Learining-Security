daren , sitara has two different prices for may 31 , 2001 causing a problem .
according to lee papayoti , the price for the swing volumes should
behsc _ flw + 1 high . gdp . d . a . however it is priced at hsc . gdp . d . a with the 31 st
being priced at both . this is causing settlements to be overstated by
419 mmbtu and $ 1 , 432 . 66 . any help you could give would be greatly
appreciated . my phone # is 713 - 571 - 3273 .

i tried to get into the sitara ticket # 373590 to correct the swing pricing
. . . . but i am not allowed to access it beacuse it is a deal from when we
were at enron and i can ' t access those deals . . . .
please ask joanie or somebody as to what to try next , as i am at a loss ! !
