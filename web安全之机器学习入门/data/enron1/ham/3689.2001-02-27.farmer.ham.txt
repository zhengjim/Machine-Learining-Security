Subject: ces imbalances
daren ,
can you please verify for me whether we took over any old imbalances that ces
had ? the reason i am asking if we got a letter from kinder morgan asking us
to verify an imbalance . it looks like it would of been an imbalance between
ces and kinder morgan . we don ' t show anything in our system and want to
verify that we shouldn ' t .
thanks and if i need to provide any further information , please let me know .
