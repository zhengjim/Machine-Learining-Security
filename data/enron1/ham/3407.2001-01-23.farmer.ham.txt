Subject: texoma - beaumont interconnect
mobil says the low point of their takes will be during february will be from
feb 1 to 14 . so any day in that time period would be a good time for hpl to
do the required maintenance at the texoma - beaumont system interconnect .
we need to define our game plan :
- what day to do the work
- how much gas hpl will deliver through our own meter
- how we use centana to deliver the rest of the hpl volumes
- if we had planned in feb to baseload some of our midcon obligation at mobil
as we have done in dec and jan , then we will need to do something different
whenever we do the maintenance
james - we are scheduled to meet with mobil in beaumont at 10 . 30 am thursday
feb 1 , to go over the game plan with them .
pat - do you want anyone from hms to attend ?
thanks
lee
