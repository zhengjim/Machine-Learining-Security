if you need it , i ' ve got a contract brief that lists the transport cost and
fuel from each location ( there numerous receipt points ) . it is possible that
we may need to purchase extra gas for the plant on occasion . in that case ,
we can use the same transport contract on lone star and transport on other
pipes also . any expense we incur to deliver gas to the plant will be passed
on to the plant .
if you have any questions , let me know .

kathy - - - - - here is what i know about cornhusker :
our supply comes from apache & williams
our market typicially is the plant ( tenaska iv partners )
if the plant is down , brazos utility has the right to the gas if they want it
if brazos does not call for the gas , then we will sell off to whomever we can
we just get a flat fee on this gas per mmbtu , whether it goes to the plant or
not
daren farmer knows the specifics about the deal
hope this helps , call with any questions .
