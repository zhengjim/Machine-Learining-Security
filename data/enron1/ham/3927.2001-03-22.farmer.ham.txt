subject : follow up
bob ,
i wanted to just follow up with you about what we had discussed a couple
weeks ago . we had briefly touched on the possibility of me rotating down
with daren and working the off system scheduling .
i was talking with daren last night and he had not heard anything about
this . i plan to begin working with mark and mary next week to learn how to
schedule these pipes . before we begin this , i just wanted to make sure that
what we had discussed is still planned .
thanks for your time .
mike
