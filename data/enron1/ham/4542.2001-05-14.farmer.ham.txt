Subject: opportunity on dow pipeline
darren , per our earlier conversation , here are the facts related to the opportunity to service a plant in the freeport area off of dow .
the potential customer ( don owen ) has supplied this plant for the past 15 years , buying supply from dow .
dow does not want to be a supplier in the future , but of course , will transport .
dow will quote only a 2 year transport ( $ 0 . 06 from katy to the plant ) , but the customer wants a minimum of 5 years .
other bids he is getting at index + . 03 / . 04 less whatever transport .
the swing load is approx . 1300 - 1350 mmbtu / d , but fairly steady he says .
let me know if you have any interest or if i should pass this along to someone else . thanks .
ps the customer will give more info if we are interested , but wanted to see if we have interest first ( and also if we had long term capacity on dow )
