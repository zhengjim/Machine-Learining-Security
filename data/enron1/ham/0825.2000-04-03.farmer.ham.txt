Subject: king ranch
stella ,
it is very important that king ranch is accurately scheduled in the
system . sitara should be updated
with any changes so that daren can properly manage the texas desk position .
hopefully we have moved
enough off of your desk to allow you to concentrate on king ranch . too many
discrepancies have been made
and it is very costly to the desk . robert can assist if needed .
thanks , pat
