Subject: re : hpl meter # 980074 bammel hpl d / p to transco
daren - what happened in feb . was that transco had allocated a different
amount other than our measurement . i had been working with fred on getting
some allocations resolved for several different months . transco told us they
would not go back and reallocate due to the statute of limitations ( 6
months ) . february had a significant amount not allocated . we just need a
deal set up so we can write these volumes off . let me know if you have any
more questions .
