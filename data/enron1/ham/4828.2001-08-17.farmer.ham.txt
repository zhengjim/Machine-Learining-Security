the pricing for the base deal is based on the gd , but it ' s the average of the gas daily plus . 02 , right ? and i was told that sitara could not handle this pricing structure , that it had to be calculated and entered as a fixed price . is this correct ?

jay ,
for june , i need a couple of things changed in sitara :
deal 819592 - the commodity price needs to be 3 . 6318
deal 819594 - the commodity price needs to be waha . hub . gdp . d . a + . 02
and for july . . . . . . . . . . . .
it looks like we ' re missing some volume . . . . . . . . . . . .
deal 895651 - baseload deal - should have 55 , 000 per day allocated . and in sitara this deal should be priced at $ 3 . 0505 .
deal 895691 - swing deal - currently has 234 , 000 in the scheduled column and it should be 441 , 000 based on the spreadsheet i sent . did you have some conflicting volumes ? i ' m resending what the volumes should be . and the pricing for this should be at waha . hub . gdp . d . a + . 02 .

i think that should do if for now . i ' ll wait to see how these changes come across . please notify me when these changes have been made . thanks !
