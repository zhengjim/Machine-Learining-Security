i ' ll get with brenda on february and brian will be getting me march . ken
seaman should have be correct because i personally made him inactive on feb
15 th ( the final day of his last pay period . . . we couldn ' t do it his real
last day because we had to allow that pay period to finish out so it would
kick out a timesheet for him . ) the specialist may actually be ami because
her title was incorrect for awhile ( but we ' ll look at it to make sure ) .
i ' ll keep you posted .

yvette ,
starting with march , all labor distribution reports will come through me , and
i will distribute them . brenda should have received all of the labor reports
for the rc ' s that report to her for february . i say " should have " because
they were supposed to be sent out by someone else . i will try get you a
copy of the february reports and send them to you .
hopefully in the future with me controlling the distribution , we will not
have this problem .
thanks ,
brian
