Subject: re : shut - in of # 986315
fyi - we don ' t have any active contracts behind this meter . there was a
dedicated reserves purchase contract with phoenix gas pipeline company that
terminated 7 / 31 / 99 . there was also a gtc - lst purchaser / marketer with el
sordo gathering systems , inc . which expired 8 / 1 / 99 .
if you are aware of any other contract that we don ' t reflect in the global
contracts database , please let me know . otherwise , there isn ' t any action
that my group needs to take regarding this shut - in .

meter 0986315 shawnee spring common point was shut - in on 6 / 13 / 2000 due to
high dew point . repeated attempts by the pumper to dry out the gas have
failed . the meter will remain shut - in until the dew point is within pipeline
quality specs .

i received a call from carl drachenberg with hms at approximately 1 : 45 pm on
6 / 13 / 00 stating that he pulled a stick on meter # 986315 and it was wet and
flowing at 35 lb . i asked gary hanks what we want to do and he said to have
carl notify the producer and shut it in . i notified carl and he got in
touch with the producer and they shut the compressor down at approx . 2 pm on
6 / 13 and at that time there wasn ' t any flow . carl came back out there at 8
am on 6 / 14 and closed the valve and removed the chart . there was no flow
after they shut the unit down and it was flowing between 500 and 300 mcf .
the meter is now out of service .
any questions - you know where to find me .
