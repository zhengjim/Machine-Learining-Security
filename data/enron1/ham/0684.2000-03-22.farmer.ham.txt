we do not have deal to enter for this . you need to look at the entire midtex
line for each of the days that are out of balance . if we are short at katy ,
i would think that we would be long at dewville . ( many times , our receipts
from the midtex line at katy are offset by our deliveries to tufco at the
tap . ) this should help you fix the january problem . also , for december , you
may need to ask pg & e where they show the delivery for western . is it at hpl
katy , as our records show , or is it at pge ' s another point on the midtex
line ? in any case , we don ' t have deliveries to make . the only other remedy
is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance .

daren - can you set up a delivery deal for meter 8740 for jan 00 and dec .
99 ? i checked oss and there is an 089 operational contract that took the
swing in case the meter flows more or less than the nom . third party
contracts are supposed to stay whole . days 12 - 14 did not flow enough to
cover the noms for western . we have the same problem on jan . 25 . please let
me know , brenda herod would like this resolved today , as would i .

stacy - can you please set up a new deal for meter 8740 for dec . 99 . the
problem with this meter is , all third party transports should stay whole and
hpl takes the swing . several days the meter did not flow enough and the
third parties did not receive all of their gas . i need a delivery set up so
the 3 rd parties will stay whole . if you have any questions , please let me
know .
thanks .

aimee ,
we are still having problem with this meter . from what i understand of our
conversation a week or two ago , hpl needs to take the swing to keep the other
contracts whole . in the case where we have excess flow the hpl ( r ) contract
takes the swing . so in the case where we are short , shouldn ' t we have a hpl
( d ) contract to take the swing ? please let me know if this will work . i
need to get back with settlement today . thanks
