steve ,
two questions :
1 ) . does the answer below suffice for our needs ?
and
2 ) . if yes , and with pat ' s answer in mind , would this be a cost that would
go to your group first , then to ed as o & m , or would it go directly to ed ?
i am not sure who has the ability to control these cost more directly , you or
ed ?
thanks ,
troy

becky ,
in reviewing the spread the minimal volumes being reported are associated
with the gas that supplies instrumentation on the pipeline , i . e . pressure and
flow controllers , actuators , valve positioners , gas quality sampling and
monitoring equipment , etc .
