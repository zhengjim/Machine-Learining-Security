Subject: new storage flag
we are going to add a new drop down flag to storage in sitara to
differentiate the difference between physical and synthetic storage - as each
are
treated differently for inventory accounting purposes . a change will also
be made to global contracts and unify , and is intended to assist with oa
variances
on storage .
on the next release ( mid august ) we will add a drop down on the storage deal
type which will be a required field .
someone will need to edit the existing deals to add the flag - as it will be
a required field - physical facility or synthetic .
( we can create queries to work with you on identifying deals that need to be
converted - as well as results for global conversion )
global contracts uses the flags from sitara to set up new contracts - so
sitara will add the flag on the deal .
the flag will be stored in global contracts - which will feed the flag to
unify .
once the existing deals are converted in sitara , global contracts can add the
appropriate flag to their system .
once this is complete and unify is ready , unify can begin to feed in the
information from global contracts , and we will then
be able to differentiate the two in the accounting system .
in the interim time , you may want to identify your synthetic vs . physical
storage deals .
let me know if you have any questions .
