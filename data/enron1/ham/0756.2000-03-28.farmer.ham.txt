Subject: midlothian first nominations
jennifer / carey / darren / stacey
as i mentioned earlier , lisa hassold ( pg & e ) clarified that the pg & e delivery
point # 00534580 is for the maypearl interconnect with lone star pipeline
( rather than the other pg & e ntp 36 - inch interconnect at maypearl with
tufco ' s old ocean line ) .
again , thank you all for your help in the first nominations ( lone star north
line and lone star south line ) that midlothian energy limited partnership ,
as limited agent for abb asltom power inc , has made for testing purposes at
the midlothian power plant .
thanks
trey christensen
