Subject: 1497
daren ,
ates shows that your team has one specialist for 1497 in january and
february . please let me know if ates is incorrect for the month of january
and february . if there is a specialist in your team , we have not received a
survey from this person . this lack of information prevents your expenses
from being 100 % allocated out to the commercial teams . please fill out the
following survey and return it to me asap . if you have any questions please
call me at 3 - 3859 .
thanks ,
shari
