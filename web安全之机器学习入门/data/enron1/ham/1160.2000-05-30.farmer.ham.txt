Subject: may hours survey
attached please find the hours survey and instructions for the month of may ,
2000 .
i am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself
to those of you i have not yet met . i am being asked to take a direct roll
in the further development and rollout of the operations pricing model ( fka
transaction cost model ) . in the past , i have directed the implementation of
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the
operations pricing model ( opm ) . over the past couple of weeks my
observations of the model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of
data used in the model . it will take efforts by both you and the opm team to
get to a satisfactory level of data quality . this process can start with
this months data collection efforts . please pay particular attention this
month as the " bar is being raised " by the management of energy operations for
data quality and timeliness .
while completing the survey , take this time to review last month ' s numbers .
please return these surveys to shari mao by end of day friday , june 2 .
please note the following changes :
the nat gas rc ' s will now see deal validation and transportation rate
activities therefore , these surveys will be notably longer but will not
necessarily take more time
if the survey does not contain an activity that your team spends time on ,
please do not type any activities in the survey . contact jennifer reside at
# 35971 to discuss how to proceed .
if you have any questions relating to the model or this survey , or are unable
to meet the survey due date , please call jennifer reside at # 35971 ( shari is
on vacation this week ) .
