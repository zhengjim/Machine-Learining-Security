Subject: re : october wellhead
the heatherlock deal had a single transaction agreement attached to it . when
the contract ended the deal ended .
the other two i believe we just need a email from vance or donald setting up
a spot ticket .
vance could you look into that ? do i have the wrong contract attached ? or
is there a new contract . for camden & north central , are those just going to
be spot tickets ?
