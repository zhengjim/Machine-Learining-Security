Subject: meters 3509 & 3533
daren ,
in 12 / 00 , gary hanks asked me to add an additional nom to meters 3509 & 3533
to make it total 2500 . i asked you about it and you said that you would
probably have to increase the reliant energy - entex nom ( deal 292249 ) . in the
meantime i added the additional volume to strangers gas so that gas control
could see a 2500 nom . i have been allocating all the gas to reliant for
12 / 00 . for 1 / 01 , do you want to increase those noms ? let me know .
