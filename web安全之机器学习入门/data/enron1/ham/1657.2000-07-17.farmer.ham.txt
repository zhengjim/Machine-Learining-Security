subject : re :
since we cannot fix the deal , go ahead and put a fixed price of $ 2 . 81359 on
both lines of the may 2000 deal . this will allow us to pay correctly . if
you can , please put some comments in the deal noting the true deal price so
we have an audit trail . just let me know when it is done .
thanks ,
megan
