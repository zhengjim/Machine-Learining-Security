Subject: duke energy deal 269123 for july & november 2000 ?
daren :
thanks again for your prompt attention to this matter , i appreciate it .
there is a slight problem however , i couldn ' t find the deals for july and
november 1999 in path manager . i looked in sitara and i see where you put
the deal 269123 in for may 1999 , but it is also in for july and november of
2000 . did you mean to put the deal in for july and november of 1999 and
inadvertently put it in for july and november 2000 ? if so would you put it
in for july and november 1999 and send me an e - mail when you are done .
thanks ,
fred

stephanie :
meter 6757 is done , redraft your invoice for both months and let me know if
this meter is still an issue .
meter 5192 . i never heard back from aimee on which transport contract to
attach the deal 269123 to so for the months in question the gas is still
allocated to the strangers gas contract . aimee is out on vacation until
mid - june so i put in a call to daren farmer to find out which transport
contract i should attach the deal 269123 to .
when i find out which transport contract to use i will set up the accounting
arrangements and then get robert lloyd to put the contract in pops and
reallocate .

aimee :
please put the ena 201 contract at this meter for april and may of 1999 with
the track id 117848 and reallocate the meter for both months . after this is
done please let stephanie and i know so that she can redraft her invoice the
next day after pops bridges to mops . also with respect to the second issue
where daren is asking for the price , stephanie may be able to help you with
this because she has a copy of duke ' s invoice .
stephanie :
the crow o ' conner meter is essentially fixed . when aimee reallocates you
will have to wait until the next day to redraft your invoice . when aimee
gets back with us please redraft the invoice the next day and let me know if
this issue is resolved .
