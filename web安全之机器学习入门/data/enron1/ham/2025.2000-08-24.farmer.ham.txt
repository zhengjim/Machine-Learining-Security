Subject: final cp name change and merger report 08 / 00
just to clarify , i was in the february 2000 report in error when i sent the
report out to everyone . please notice at the bottom of the report that there
is a worksheet tab for august 2000 and that is where the current information
is located . i apologize for the confusion .
