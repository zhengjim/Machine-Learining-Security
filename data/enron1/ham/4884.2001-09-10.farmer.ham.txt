Subject: coserv proposal
tom , eric , daren and gary ,
attached below is a file that i have put together detailing out a proposal for gas to coserv ( natural gas distribution unit of denton county electric cooperative ) . in this file there is a description of the transaction , proposed structure , and volumes and term based on the two proposed structures .
the second file is the actual one page proposal sent by coserv .
this proposal is due wednesday and i need to get offers for index and fixed price term intrastate gas for baseload volumes delivered at the katy , waha , and carthage lonestar connections . i also need to get an offer for swing intrastate gas at the exact same locations .
shout at me if you have questions or if we need to discuss this further .
thanks ,
jd
