daren :
can you shed a little light on this tenaska iv deal ? james armstrong is
telling me that we should have a purchase deal in the system to pay tenaska
iv for the 9 / 00 and 10 / 00 gas that we are marketing for them . i do not see a
deal in path manager for either month . i also need some detail on who we are
buying and selling this gas from and to . there are a number of
counterparties at lonestar for ena and i ' m not sure which ones go with this
deal . is there a schedule you can email to me ? james is looking for an
answer today on the tenaska iv payment , so whatever you can tell me will be
appreciated .
thanks ,
megan
