Subject: panenergy 4 / 01
daren :
did we exchange with panenergy in april ? if we did , can you send me your nom sheet ? meter 7052 - castle busby looks different this month . elsa did some deals with highland energy at 7052 . we normally buy all of the gas from duke at this meter when we exchange . there also wasn ' t flow every day , so duke ' s volume is very small .
thanks ,
megan
