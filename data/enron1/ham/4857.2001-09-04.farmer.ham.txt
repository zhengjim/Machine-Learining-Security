ena was invoiced by coral energy for two deals on tejas for june 2001 that i do not see in the system . the first deal was on 6 / 1 for 5 , 400 at $ 3 . 87 . the second deal was on 6 / 13 for 22 , 000 at $ 4 . 25 . do you know anything about these deals ? i think we would show it on exxonkaty , but i can ' t find anything in path manager on exxonkaty or tejas .
