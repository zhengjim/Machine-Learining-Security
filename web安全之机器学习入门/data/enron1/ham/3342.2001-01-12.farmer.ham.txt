Subject: new stack manager
there is a new version of stack manager which is being released this evening ,
for use on monday morning .
changes
1 ) " inactivate suspended children " - new menu item available by
right - clicking on a parent product . it will change all child products of the
highlighted parent from " suspended " to " inactive " . note that this will be
applied only to the product which you highlight . it will also show available
when highlighting products which are not parents , but it will have no effect .
2 ) the transaction list has been amended to correctly display only those
transactions completed on the calendar day ( problem has affected australia
and singapore ) .
3 ) a constant spread which is changed from the front page of the stack
manager will stay as changed for that product . the spread will persist even
if transactions occur .
background
suspended child products continue to have their prices updated as the price
of the parent changes . inactive child products do not have their prices
updated . the price update process slows down enrononline processing and stack
manager response , so it is advantageous to ensure all non - active products are
in an inactive state .
if you have any questions on the above , please contact the enrononline call
