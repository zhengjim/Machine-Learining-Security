larry and jim ,
thank you for expressing your interest in responding to valero energy
corporation ' s request for proposals for natural gas supplies . please find
attached a file containing daily consumption data for most of valero ' s
major facilities in texas , california and new jersey . certain other smaller
accounts such as valero ' s asphalt plants in california and texas are not
represented at this time . in lieu of daily data for these accounts , valero
intends to provide summary level data in the near future . daily data for
the clearlake methanol plant will be provided at a later date when it
becomes available . in the meantime , please refer to the rfp for the summary
data and associated discussion regarding the market environment for
domestic methanol production .
please treat the provided data as confidential per the confidentiality
agreement executed between valero and your company . power use data has been
sent via overnight mail . as questions arise , please send them to my
attention .
thanks ,
dave
