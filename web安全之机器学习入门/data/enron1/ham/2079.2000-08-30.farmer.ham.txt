does it make a difference if the information is communicated via a copy of
customer " force majeure " letter or should it only be communicated
via notes mail .
there are several ways to communicate effectively issues that is beneficial
to other departments , do you have a preference ?

deliveries to this meter were halted late in the day of january 20 . the
customer has maintenance issues that necessitated an earlier than planned
turnaround .
it is my understanding from our trader this is another force majure situation
resulting in no sale or buyback at this meter commencing with the shutdown .
please take this into consideration when allocating and billing the customer .
thanks
