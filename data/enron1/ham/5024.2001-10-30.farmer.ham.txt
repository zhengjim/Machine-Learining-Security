becky ,
can we get a copy of this filing ? i have a meeting with mitchell next wednesday and i would like to know more about the filing and will find out more about the pipeline . these are the very things we should be protesting as we move forward with our new business in texas .
if you will advise me what additional information you will need for the protest , our desk will work to assist you in gathering the data .

i am not familiar with this system but it seems philosophically we should protest even though we don ' t currently do any business on this pipeline .
what do you guys think ?
tom

tom , does your group have any dealings with acacia natural gas ? it ' s a texas intrastate owned by mitchell . they have made a filing for approval of section 311 rates for interruptible service and they have set up their operating conditions so their affiliate will get higher priority over other parties who are paying the same rate ( priority within the same rate will be based on whoever has the earliest transportation agreement ) .
would appreciate hearing from you in the next day or so . comments are due on the filing by nov . 7 th , and if we want to protest , we ' ll have to get our facts together .
thanks .
becky .
