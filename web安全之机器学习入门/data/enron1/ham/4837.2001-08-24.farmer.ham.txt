Subject: conoco - big cowboy
darren :
i ' m not sure if you can help me with this , but i don ' t know who else to ask . for april and may , we have gas pathed on deal 133304 to conoco at the gepl big cowboy point . conoco is saying that we did not buy that gas from them . they have accounted for all of the hpl big cowboy gas and think we have over paid by about $ 1 . 5 mil each month for the gepl gas . do you know why we added the gepl meter to the deal in april ? could we have bought this gas from someone else ? i have the meter statements from tejas , but they do not say who the supply company was .
