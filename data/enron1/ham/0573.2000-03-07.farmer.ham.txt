Subject: just a note
hi ,
i figured something must be occupying your time other than answering
non - business e - mail .
you guys must all be getting double salaries for doing 2 jobs each . - - - -
right ? ( chuckle ) .
if tom really lets you take the time off for the baby and if you really have
the time ; lunch would be great . just give me a call . only if all the ifs
really allow you the time .
is craig ok ? ? i hope .
i would be glad to help with your sprinkler system . my sharpshooter is older
than you are , but i imagine it is built a little better . my requested wages
for that sort of work would make renting a trencher very cheap for you . i
would be happy to come by and keep an eye on the cold beer . that would be
free of charge .
i ' m having a cable modem installed monday . supposed to be 50 - 70 times faster
than what i have . i do way to much jumping around to run off this slow modem .
i can then dump my other phone line . actually will end up spending less for
more speed . i love technology .
thanks for the info on the stock option . that is the closing price as of
1 / 18 / 00 , which is right before the jump . very nice of management . i like to
know the number to see what might be affecting the price .
well good luck on the extra job and give our best to tonya - - - - not much
longer to go . . . . . . . . . . .
