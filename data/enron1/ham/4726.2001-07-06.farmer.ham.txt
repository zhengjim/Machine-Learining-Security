i looked at the service records and , for oct 2000 through april 2001 , we have paid $ 381 , 263 . 04 to txu for transport . we have another $ 159 , 745 . 14 in draft status . the two amounts total $ 541 , 008 . 18 . i ' m not sure why we have items in draft status . antoinette beale handles the transport payments and i think she is out today . i know she was having trouble with the volumes coming over . i have left her a message to call me when she gets back so we can finalize those payments . the may 2001 estimates total $ 57 , 249 . 44 in the system . let me know if you need any more information .
