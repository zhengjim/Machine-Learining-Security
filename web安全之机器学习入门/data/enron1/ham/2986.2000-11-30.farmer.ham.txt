Subject: beaumont methanol
this is to confirm that we need to take our delivery to hpl meter # 1428 to
zero ! !
beaumont methanol started a controlled shut - down last night ( they will be
down in deco 0 due to high gas prices ) . . . . and it became an " out - of - control "
shut in and they had to shut down last night , and are now taking no gas from
the dupont header .
