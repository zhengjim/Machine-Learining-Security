subject : ena origination track
all ,
ena is building an ena origination track similar to that of the trading track . originators on both the gas & power side at the vp level have bought into the development of this program . the management of the program will be the originators themselves under louise kitchen . there will be structured rotations for the analysts & associates who join this program with a clear objective in mind - final rotation will be in origination .
the below people , according to our records , are currently in your groups . these candidates have been identified as they have completed at least one relevant rotation and / or have performed well in the previous prc . prior to contacting the below analysts & associates , i want to ensure your buy - in / recommendation of these candidates . all selected candidates would be formally interviewed by the origination management team ( both gas & power ) prior to joining the program .
i would be grateful for your early response as we are looking to schedule a date in november to commence interviews .
if you have any questions , please let me know and i will be happy to explain the program in greater detail .
kind regards ,
karen
