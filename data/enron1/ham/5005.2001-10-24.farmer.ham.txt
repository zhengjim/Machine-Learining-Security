i spoke with dan burns at el paso yesterday .
he notionally gave me a $ 0 . 04 rate from exxon clear lake
or comparable source . seems a bit high .
hpl quoted us $ 0 . 025 from katy on the marathon refinery
rfp last week but they wanted $ 0 . 25 for swing transport .
gary talked to exxon and tejas about sourcing gas into
crosstex ( was cc transmission ) at banquette . exxon
apparently sells their equity gas at the tailgate of king ranch
because of recent changes or elimination of their tejas
transportation agreement / s .
lets discuss ,
