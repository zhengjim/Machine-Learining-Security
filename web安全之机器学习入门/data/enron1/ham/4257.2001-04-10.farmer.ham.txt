i will update again thursday and will include a column for status .
we are in the process of drafting procedures which will have to become a formal protocol for aep .
these are :
request for new / maintenance of counterparties . once web page is developed , procedures will
be completed .
request for new portfolios ( books ) after close . drafting procedures .
request for new employee security .
request to change curve mapping in erms / cps . drafting procedures .
also , it appears the it service agreement may have to be amended to cover the
web pages used to push operational data to customers ( if aep wants to continue
the service ) and the tariff filing system we just put into production .
also , we will need to resolve how we handle counterparties that enron credit has request we suspend trading when
aep wants to continue trading .
we have had discussions with aep about all of these issues and procedures .
