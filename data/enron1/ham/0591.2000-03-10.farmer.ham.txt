hi daren ,
can you please check into whether or not the below deals for the above meters
can be rolled and extended ? if so , can you please perform this for me so
that anita can set up an accounting arrangement for me ?
98 - 6719 sitara deal # 166989 flow @ meter began on february 10 th but the deal
is not effective until february the 11 th .
no new deal # referenced and no evergreen flag . this is on the
gathering ( 96026573 ) k which is the only
k @ the meter .
98 - 9676 sitara deal # 151669 deal good from 1 / 1 / 00 - 1 / 31 / 00 but there is
flow for all of february 2000 with no k . this is on the 215 k for 1 / 2000
production which is the only k @ the meter .
