i spoke with bob dorcheus , brandywine about this issue and he suggest you
and he get together and agree on a
price because the gas flowed into the plant .
this gas flowed without a nomination .

the volumes on meter # 1266 for 7 / 1 / 00 and 7 / 31 / 00 are valid gas flow . 7 / 1 / 00
volumes are carry over from june activity ( meter was shut in a little after
9 : 00 am on 7 / 1 / 00 ) . 7 / 31 / 00 volumes were caused by the plant bringing on
the meter before 9 : 00 am on 8 / 1 / 00 .
if you have any questions please call . 36449 .
thanks
