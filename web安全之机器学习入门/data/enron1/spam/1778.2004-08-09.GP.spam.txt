three studies assessed staphylococcal endocarditis 21 48 63 one study
assessed any staphylococcal infection 32 and one assessed streptococcal
endocarditis 69 treatment is well ingrained in
existing guidelines and clinical practice with these infections 94 so what
have i done about it ? well its still a practicing effort , but i dont just
listen to what a man says . i look to see the connection in a mans actions .
are they putting as much of an effort into the relationship ? do i feel that
they really feel what they say they are feeling ? and to a fault , i am
skeptical at best that they truly mean what they say . our best ally is our
gut feeling c and we are very guilty of ignoring it . when we ignore it we
are destined to get hurt .
