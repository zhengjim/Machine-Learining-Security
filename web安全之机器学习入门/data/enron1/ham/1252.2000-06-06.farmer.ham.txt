Subject: new su bridge
some people are having problems getting the new monitor -
you may not have the su bridge under your -
start - programs - trading - sitara - su bridge monitor .
to resolve this - you will need to fill out a security request to get it
added to your start up profile .
also - if you are using an old shortcut - this may no longer work - you need
to trash the old short cut .
