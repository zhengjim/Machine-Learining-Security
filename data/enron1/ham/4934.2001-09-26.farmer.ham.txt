in follow up to our discussion yesterday , here is the information i am using to describe our waha hubco project as it relates to the compression services deal with unocal .
as you know , we are in discussion with nng about managing their storage agreement and with sid richardson / transco to develop an " intrastate " header system for sid richardson ' s gas that will also be connected to the unocal plant . we need to keep coordinated on these discussions .
regards ,
