subject : change name on pipeline , contract no . teco 9121 , global contract no .

please be advised that contract no . teco 9121 shows in the global contract
system as pg & e texas pipeline , l . p . , however , the pipeline name should be
pg & e gas transmission teco , inc . . apparently , the pipeline name was entered
into the global system incorrectly . i have confirmed this with charles berner
in the contracts administration section and kim watson , both with pg & e gas
transmission teco , inc . . the contract name should be pg & e gas transmission
teco , inc .
i would like to change the pipeline to reflect the correct pipeline name
effective april 1 , 2000 . thus it will not affect the previous noms for this
contract .
all please respond to let me know if this will cause problems with
replication or anything else with the system .
julie and stacey , deal no . 47434 is attached to this contract you may need
to change this in your system .
