Subject: sap changes
with sap now here there are going to be a few minor changes that we will all
have to make immediately .
first :
everyone will have to make internet explorer their default browser . if
you ' re not sure how to do this give me a call and i will help . the reason
for this is that our new timesheet program will only run through internet
explorer .
second :
sometime next week we will have a brown bag lunch where i will walk you
through entering your time in this new system . it ' s not time consuming just
different .
third :
next thursday you will be e - mailed an sap log - on id and password . please
don ' t delete or disregard the importance of this e - mail . you will need it to
key your time .
fourth :
all company and rc # ' s are changing . the company part is easy . it will be 4
digits so if your company number is currently 413 it will now be 0413 or if
it is 012 it will now be 0012 . easy . rc # ' s are now called cost centers and
they are changing completely . please write these down somewhere you will
need them just like you need to know your rc .
rc 1497 = cc 105633
rc 1638 = cc 105634
rc 2664 = cc 105630
rc 2933 = cc 106292
rc 0688 = cc 105631
rc 1160 = cc 105632
rc 2675 = cc 105638
rc 2939 = cc 106269
rc 2940 = cc 106290
rc 2663 = cc 105629
the transition shouldn ' t be too painful for you but it promises to be a
little stressful for your assistants so please bear with us and cooperate .
thank you !
