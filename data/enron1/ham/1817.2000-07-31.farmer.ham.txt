Subject: cleburne outage
gentlemen ,
i wanted to clarify the length of the outage that started today at the
cleburne site .
the earliest the plant will be on - line is wednesday morning . if anything is
found beyond a cracked transition piece or clogged fuel nozzle then it may
extend the outage a few days . as soon as i hear something i will let you know .
