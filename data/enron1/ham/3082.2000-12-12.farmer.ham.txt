Subject: succession plan
it is my great pleasure to announce that the board has accepted my
recommendation to appoint jeff skilling as chief executive officer , effective
at the time of their next board meeting on february 12 , 2001 . jeff will also
retain his duties as president and chief operating officer . i will continue
as chairman of the board and will remain at enron , working with jeff on the
strategic direction of the company and our day - to - day global operations .
jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all
cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth . he is clearly ready for
the job , and after 15 years as ceo of this great company , i  , m ready for a
somewhat different role .
our succession plan has been clear for some time . this has afforded jeff and
me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that
continues to exceed everyone  , s expectations , including our own . we look
forward to furthering that relationship as jeff expands his role .
there are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad
shifts in strategy and direction .
please join me in congratulating jeff . i look forward to a great 2001 .
