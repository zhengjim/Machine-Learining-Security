please note that i have re - formatted the attachment to an excel spreadsheet .
try the attachment and let me know if you have any problems . also , in
discussion with duke , txu fuel co . does not have a transportation agreement
with
duke for the redelivery of this gas . the agreement is between enron and duke .
according to brian kerns of duke , they basically took assignment of the
existing
transportation agreement enron had with pg & e ( now el paso ) . if this is the
case , then we should be using the nominated amount as the driver towards
meeting
our monthly minimum purchase obligation . any imbalance between enron and duke
on the duke system receipts would be transparent to txu and worked out between
enron and duke . any imbalance between the nominated volumed and the actual
volumes received at the " teco tap " would need to be worked out between enron
and
txu fuel co . there are a couple of different ways to work this out , but i
need
to review the contract first . please look at this on your side and lets come
to
an agreement as soon as possible since the end of the month is quickly
approaching .
thanks ,
ccs
