we need to revisit this issue again . there is an exception at meter 4045
for 2 / 99 . in order to clear this up , i need an ect transport delivery at
this meter for the 34000 mmbtu . see july ' s allocations in pops for
reference . the displacement gas were scheduled as a delivery .
i would like to have this issue resolved as soon as possible so that we
could clear this off our list .
let me know if you have questions .
thanks

kim ,
ect sold 34 , 000 mmbtu to panenergy at meter 4045 for 2 / 99 . i ' ve verified w /
rebekah seales and she has determined that ect did sell this gas to
panenergy . therefore , we need to show a delivery at this meter for panenergy
or whomever panenergy is selling this gas to at this point in pops . i need a
delivery at this meter in order for this meter to balanced .
please take a look at this . call me if you have questions
thanks .

anita :
i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

additional info i see in path manager . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
seems like this is a brokered deal , ect is buying 20 , 000 mmbtu from philips
gas and 14 , 000 mmbtu from superior gas and sell the total 34 , 000 mmbtu to
panenergy .
my question is then who is paying for the tranport of this gas , ect or
panenergy ? we need to schedule for the delivery of this gas at meter 984045 .
please let me know
thanks
