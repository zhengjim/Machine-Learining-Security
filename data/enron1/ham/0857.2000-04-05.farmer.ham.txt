Subject: deletion of your enrononline user id
password deletion
it has been noted that many users have passwords which match or are similar
to their user id ' s for internal enrononline applications ( stack manager ,
product manager , eol reports ) .
this is a significant security concern . therefore , there will be a sweep of
id ' s and passwords at the end of the day on thursday , april 5 . any user id ' s
which have passwords similar to the user id will be subject to deletion .
changing your password
passwords can be changed in either the stack manager or in eol reports .
to change your password in the stack manager , once logged on , go to toolbar &
select " help " and then select " change password " .
the system will request you to enter your new password twice .
to change your passsword in eol reports , open the reports application , log
in , select " options " and " change password " . the system will request you to
enter your new password twice . please note that the password change
functionality within the reports application is new . if it does not appear on
your menu and you are running on a standalone machine , you will need to
logout at the windows level and then login again to receive the updated
version .
if you have any questions , please call the enrononline help desk ( houston :
