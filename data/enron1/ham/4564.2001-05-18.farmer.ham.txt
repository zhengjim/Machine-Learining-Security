bad news . . . . . the cleburne imbalance is out of control . you might want to start some payback to lonestar . lonestar ' s estimates for the accumulative imbalance at the beginning of may was 140 . 0 due them , now i guess their actuals came in and now at the beginning of may shows 214 . 0 due them . i am waiting to hear back from lisa with lonestar to see why there is such a big discrepancy . through the 16 th , her updated estimates reflect an imbalance of 240 . 0 due them . . . . the plant continues to overpull , our nom to the plant which is not all 45 . 0 due to brazos ' take .
