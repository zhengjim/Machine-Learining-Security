victor ,
what ' s your opinion on this ? can we go back and add days to prior month
deals ? do we use the same price ? if we do decide to do this , we will need
to get tetco to agree to do a retro for those days as well .

subject : 10 / 2000 - days 6 and 19 ( 98 - 0439 )
the above referenced days have been placed on strangers gas due to ( i guess )
the meter not being turned off in time . the day prior to each of these days
that are assessed to strangers gas , the only active k is the hpl 216 .
can these deals be rolled to cover these couple of days ?
thanks
