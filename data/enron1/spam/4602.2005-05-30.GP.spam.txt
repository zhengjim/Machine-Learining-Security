bnp petroleum corporation , inc . is an irving based oil and gas
exploration and development ( ed ) company . bnp petroleum corporation , inc . was
formed for the purpose of development and operation of oil and gas
properties with proven reserves . the company ' s strategy is to focus in
domestic areas where major oil and gas producing companies have reduced
their exploration efforts to move offshore and overseas in search of the
larger reserves . considerable oil and gas in proven fields remain to be
exploited by well - managed independent oil companies capable of
extracting these reserves at lower risk and lower cost than unproved prospects .
bnp petroleum ' s initial development strategy has been to acquire such
proven fields and increase production through the application of
advanced technology and the exploration of other proven formations in the same
fields .
bnp petroleum corporation ' s primary operational strategy includes the
operation of its own projects , giving it substantial control over
drilling and production costs . the company has associated with highly
experienced exploration and development engineering and geology personnel that
strive to add production at lower costs through development drilling ,
workovers , behind pipe recompletions and secondary recovery operations .
the company ' s long - term strategy is to build an oil and gas production
company through a strategic combination of selected property
acquisitions and an exploration program . additionally , the company will continue
to rework existing wells in an attempt to increase production and
reserves .
