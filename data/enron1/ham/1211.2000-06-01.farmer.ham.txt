harris county , tx
our gas supply contract with lubrizol expired effective may 1 , 2000 and
lubrizol began purchasing from tejas . lubrizol has decided not to execute a
keep - ready agreement with hpl to keep this meter on stand - by . therefore ,
please take the necessary steps to classify this meter as ' inactive ' and
insure that no future volumes flow through this meter .
charlie - we will leave this station in place for now and try to recapture
this market in three years . please have this station locked and secured as
soon as possible to prevent lubrizol from taking any unauthorized volumes
should tejas be unable to deliver gas for any reason .
thanks , gerald ( # 39919 )
