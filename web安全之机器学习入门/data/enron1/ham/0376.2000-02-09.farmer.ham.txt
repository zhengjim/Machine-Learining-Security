Subject: 987012

987341 for the meters that you had nominated under the 987012 . under
aggregate 7012 is 4045 ; 6026 ; 6114 ; 6427 ; 6848 ; 9755 ; these should all be
under the 987341 . do we need to renominate these meters or do i just move
them in pops . let me know daren i aim to please ( i think that ' s a southern
