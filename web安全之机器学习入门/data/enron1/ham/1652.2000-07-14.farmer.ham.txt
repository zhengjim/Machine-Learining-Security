shipper
daren wanted me to make this request to you for an equistar buyback ticket
on enron north america { ena } .
equistar has nominated activity on ena for june and july 2000 production .
settlement seems to think a buyback ticket is necessary to properly account
for equistar ' s monthly activity .
