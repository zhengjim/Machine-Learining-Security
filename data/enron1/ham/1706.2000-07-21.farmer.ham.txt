Subject: re : saudi arabia
i spoke to mr . maldinado this morning and it doesn ' t look good . he claims he
has a connection to the minister of " energy " who will allocate gas to him . i
asked where would the gas be delivered , and he said anywhere you want it .
short term or long term ? again , anything you want , but probably long term is
better .
i pointed out that there isn ' t an energy minister in saudi and would he know
the name of the minister whose giving him the gas ? he stumbled and couldn ' t
remember the name .
finally he said " what do you have to lose ? just send me a letter requesting
gas with the specs , location and duration " and he ' ll do his best to get it .
if you want to try it rob , he ' s all yours . his fax number is 562 / 866 - 7368 ,
address 16276 grand avenue , bellflower , ca 90706 .
regards ,
samir

rob ,
i got your name from doug leach . he thought that you would be the person to
talk to about this .
i got a call last night from rudolph maldonado . ( the operator forwarded him
our way . ) he stated that he has some natural gas to sell in saudi arabia .
his number is 562 - 866 - 1755 . could you give him a call and check this out ? i
told him that i would find someone that he could discuss this with .
i can be reached at 3 - 6905 if you have any questions .
