subject : hpl deal downloads
i ' ve attached two files with hpl deal information . the file named hpl deals
with 3 rd parties contain all hplc deals and ena deals on hpl . i plan to send
this file to aep by tueday morning unless i hear of any objection . the
second file named ena texas offsystem deals contains deals that i ' m not sure
if they are a part of the sale or not . i am asking david baumbach to review
this file to let me know what needs to be excluded . i will hold off on
sending the second file until their is consensus on the content . - tommy
