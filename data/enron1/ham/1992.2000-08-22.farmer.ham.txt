karen ,
i realize this . it appears as if you ' re asking me to have day 16 added to
the sitara deal ticket so that all volumes that flowed for that day can
allocate to this deal .
maybe you might want to phone me if this is not the case .

karen ,
i ' ve looked in pops and on day 16 of january 1999 , i see a total confirmed
volume of 61 , 365 and an actual of 62 , 151 . if i ' m understanding you
correctly , you ' re asking me to allocate all of this volume to deal # 51862 .
if so , that ' s incorrect . several deals are associated the this days volume .
please write back or phone back with further details .
thanks
