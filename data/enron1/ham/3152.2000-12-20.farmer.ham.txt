we billed wyman gordon 363 mmbtus at $ 4 . 7328 in sept 2000 .
i spoke with richard moran at wyman gordon and he indicated that he has not
had any physical gas deals with us in over a year and does not owe us the
$ 1 , 718 . 01 we billed him for september .
can you please validate if this is his gas or if this deal ticket should have
been linked to some type of financial deal .
thanks - katherine
