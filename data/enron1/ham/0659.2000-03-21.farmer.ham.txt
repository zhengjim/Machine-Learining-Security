Subject: re : cilco storage
yes , they are taken care of . but in the future we need to devise some sort of
communication from lisa kinsey so if there
is a change with cilco , it is communicated to either you or me or aimee or
kenny or someone and it is reflected on our
withdrawal report .

the cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to cilco . please
review the attached the spreadsheets from lisa kinsey , the central desk
scheduler responsible for the cilco account . the biggest variance is in
january 2000 . cilco withdrew 200 , 000 mmbtu ' s more than we booked @ bammel .
please let me know the best way to correct the problem . i suspect the
variance is showing up as a transport imbalance . also , the nomination for
the current month is 7 , 327 mmbtu instead of 7 , 000 mmbtu per day . 7 , 000 is
the volume delivered to cilco after transport fuel .
