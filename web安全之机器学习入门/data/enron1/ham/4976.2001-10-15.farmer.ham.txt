brian - this relates to an imbalance due enron pre - june 2001 . aep / hpl is negotiating on enron ' s behalf to clear these historical imbalances . lobo wants to pay this gas back on wednesday . you guys can take this in and transport it on hpl to a market ( for a fee , of course ) or you can outright sell it to hpl after taking receipt at king ranch . it is up to you . i realize that wednesday may be short notice . i was not a party to determining the date of this resolution and have no problem getting these guys to hold off , if need be . just let me know how you want to proceed . i ' m at 832 - 668 - 1181 . thanks .
