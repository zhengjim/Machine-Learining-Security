russ , different subject . . . could you go ahead and change ( or add ) in sitara position mgr where lonestar , waha , carthage and katy roll up to . instead of rolling up to ena im texas , have them roll up to ena im lonestar . i need this changed because i think the aep people will still have access to see ena im texas on sitara position mgr through the end of may and we don ' t want them to see our positions in our new portfolios .

rollup desks do not work in ticker . rollup desks just subtotal positions from the desks that make them up , they do not see deals on
a deal level . you also can not drill down to a deal level from position manager for the same reason .
