Subject: re : exxon company , usa global # 96035668 / sitara # 212225
i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal ( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language & they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow for evergreen & included something about a " 10 day notification " to terminate , there isn ' t any reason to " terminate " this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

please prepare and send a termination letter by tomorrow march 16 , 2001 on the above referenced deal . houston pipe line company has not renegotiated a price and have no interest in buying the gas on an evergreen basis . it is my understanding that we need to notify them within 10 days of the end of the delivery period
. if you need any additional information or have any questions , please contact me at 35656 . thanks . emv
