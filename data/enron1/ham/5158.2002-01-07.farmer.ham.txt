on monday we have to file a " transition plan " with louise kitchen for netco . she wants details . on that note i need a status report from each desk on our effort to start the contract process for pipes , tpa ' s & ebb ' s so i can include that in the report . i have received some emails however i would like each manager to put together a summary in an excel spreadsheet that we can have suzanne consolidate with the stuff she already put together . please cover the key items listed in the earlier email . also we should be getting as much hard copy as possible so we can proceed with our goal of preparing for a startup . i suggest reviewing the paperwork and identify the stuff that you will need to get the forms completed . no doubt we will have substantial gaps but as long as we know where and what they are we can get the proper internal people involved ( legal , credit , etc . )
tks - bob
