Subject: thanks ! !
just a note to tell each of you that i appreciate your efforts today in our
lengthy meeting . i think you all were very professional , and you all asked
the right questions of each other . i was very proud of the level of
performance i saw today , and think this group has strengthened over the last
six months , which was one of our goals . the challenges today were healthy
and with merit . i realize it is a difficult process , but i appreciate your
patience to work through the process . i know each of you realize the
importance of our building a strong team , as we are only as strong as our
people . we are required to identify strengths and weaknesses to help the
employee become stronger . enron is the best , and we are obligated to build
the very best teams to ensure we deliver the very best services . if we do
not , we all fail .
good job , today . once again , thank you .
