Subject: industrial accounts
i will leave robert to the above accounts . i will refer all contacts on this
subject to him for handling .
it is my personal belief that robert is not yet ready to provide all the
services necessary in this area , but i also know that full responsibility
often is a good teacher .
pat , as far as i ' m concerned i ' m out of the game .
i will help daren if needed and if not i ' ll be on my way .
good luck to you in your endeavors .
