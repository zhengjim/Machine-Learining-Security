Subject: txu lone star
i am working on clearing an old txu lone star / gas distribution balance from
8 / 99 and 9 / 99 . we originally billed txu on nominated quantities and they
have shortpaid us due to meter adjustments . these are brokered deals where
we sold to txu and purchased from exxonmobil and highland . txu has provided
meter support since the deals were on lone star pipeline , however , i am
unsure how to have volume management reallocate .
for example , we originally sold 10 , 000 mmbtu on 8 / 3 / 99 to txu and purchased
1 , 200 mmbtu from highland energy and 8 , 800 mmbtu from exxonmobil . txu shows
the total amount of gas on 8 / 3 / 99 was 9 , 240 mmbtu . how should the purchase
piece be allocated between exxonmobil and highland since this was a brokered
deal ?
