Subject: calpine force majeure - dec 99
hi daren ,
i spoke with ricky archer at calpine about some penalty charges i billed him
for undertakes on dec 20 , 21 , 31 .
he said force majeure letters were sent to your attention .
if you have them , would you have someone fax a copy of those letters to met
at 713 - 646 - 8420 ?
do you have any other information on the force majure or should i speak with
jennifer ?
thanks for your help !
