elsa ,
i was informed to bill anything on hgpl by my supervisor , but when i talk to
priscilla hamic she informed me that hgpl should be billed by offsystem and
not the texas desk . the deals in sitara that relate to hgpl all state that
it is texas desk .
please let me know who should be billing mgi supply for hgpl volume .
thanks for your help .
