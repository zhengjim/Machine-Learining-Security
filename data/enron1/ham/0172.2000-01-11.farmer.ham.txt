Subject: upcoming sitara risk assignment release
in order to prepare for the upcoming sitara release to production scheduled
on 01 / 24 , sitara will be unavailable as follows :
production 01 / 21 ( fri . ) 7 : 00 pm ( cst ) thru 01 / 23 ( sun . ) 12 : 00 pm ( cst )
conversion and checkout of data for risk assignment release
( sitara and cpr )
parallel 01 / 14 ( fri . ) 7 : 00 pm ( cst ) thru 02 / 01 ( tue . ) 8 : 00 am ( cst ) parallel
environment will be used as hot back - up , view access only
( sitara )
i wanted to make sure everyone had plenty of advance notice . i would like
each of you to review these times with your staff . the production release is
the largest to date and the time required to convert the data cannot be
shortened any more . production users will not be impacted by the lack of the
parallel environment - we will continue to bridge deal updates to unify
parallel as we do now for the period stated above ; however access to sitara
parallel will be kept to view only . a list of items included in this release
will be forthcoming , as well as training for groups impacted by the risk
assignment change .
i appreciate your help in making this happen . any questions , please do not
hesitate to call myself or the sitara hotline ( x 37049 )
