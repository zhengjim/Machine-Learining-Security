Subject: re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
mary ,
hplc currently has a gas purchase agreement ( global # 96014987 ) in place with
calpine that extends through 5 / 31 / 2001 . sitara deal no . 133259 correctly has
this contract attached to it . effective 11 / 1 / 1998 the contract was amended
releasing gouger wells no . 5 & 6 . these wells were apparently the only
producing wells behind this point . evidence being no measured volumes in
mips . there are however other non producing wells behind this point . is
your sept
however , they were not added behind meter 6835 . therefore , i do not agree
that the deal ( 133259 ) should be edited to change the meter .
hopefully this information is useful !
vlt
x 3 - 6353

i am not sure who should handle this , so , i shared the " wealth " . on deal
ticket 133259 , purchase from calpine , the deal is input at meter 4229 , which ,
per the email below , was terminated . i have an unresolvable ua 4 issue at
meter 4229 for september and for october . i have changed the meter
designation for november forward , however , i receive an error in sitara when
i attempt to change either the prior or current month . this deal should have
been changed to meter 6835 effective back in february of this year . please
let me know what i can do to resolve this issue asap .
thanks ,
mary

cheryl ,
fyi - here is the message from mary poorman in logistics .
mary ,
cheryl is going to call the field and find out if this meter should still be
included on the termination list and also see if the field people see any gas
flow on the meter .
thanks ,
kathy

kathy and i are trying to clean up an unaccounted for issue at the above
referenced meter . the system ( pops ) does not show a bav flow or an actual
flow for prior months . kathy phoned measurement to inquire about mips
volumes and was informed that this meter is on a disabled status list back to
february , 2000 . i am showing a purchase from calpine at this meter ( deal
ticket 133259 ) on gathering agreement
i would greatly appreciate your help in determining the current status of
this meter and this deal . please forward any information you may have .
thank you for your time and patience ,
mary
