Subject: feb 12 th sale to aquila
fyi
daren - - - on the 12 th , there is a sale to aquila on the header system , for
10 , 000 . . . . . . . . i think we were supplying it with aec . for whatever reason , i
had the aec 10 . 0 @ # 11230 into midcon . . . which isnt right because there was no
market for it , and midcon wasnt looking for it , but the aquila deal was at
# 700 on wgr ( aquila ) . so i went ahead and changed the aec ticket to match up
with the aquila deal . let me know if you think it is incorrect .
thanks ,
mark
