Subject: meter 986899 for november
daren ,
i have flow at this meter for the first , 118 dth . there is an expired
purchase from highland at the meter , but , this deal ended august 31 st . hpl
had a deal with highland in october to purchase these volumes ( deal ticket
418382 ) . i think that the deal needs to be extended , it looks like the valve
was not completely shut by 9 am . pat has asked that this issue be resolved
today , so , your assistance would be greatly appreciated .
