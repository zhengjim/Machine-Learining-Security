Subject: may activity survey
attached please find the activity survey for the month of may , 2000 .
i am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself
to those of you i have not yet met . i am being asked to take a direct roll
in the further development and rollout of the operations pricing model ( fka
transaction cost model ) . in the past , i have directed the implementation of
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the
operations pricing model ( opm ) . over the past couple of weeks my
observations of the model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of
data used in the model . it will take efforts by both you and the opm team to
get to a satisfactory level of data quality . this process can start with
this months data collection efforts . please pay particular attention this
month as the " bar is being raised " by the management of energy operations for
data quality and timeliness .

teams . please select your rcs , and fill in the driver quantity for the
