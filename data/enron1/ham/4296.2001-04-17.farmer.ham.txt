per southern union ' s confirmation sheet , the 15 , 000 mmbtus spot deal on days 03 / 25 & 3 / 26 should be priced at hsc gdp da + . 05 ( at tuesday , 3 / 27 / 01 pricing - which was $ 5 . 235 ) . currently , sitara is showing a price of hsc gdp + . 05 .
is this tuesday pricing correct ? if so , pls forward this to daren so that he can change the price in sitara to $ 5 . 235 + . 05 ( totaling $ 5 . 285 ) .
thanks - katherine
