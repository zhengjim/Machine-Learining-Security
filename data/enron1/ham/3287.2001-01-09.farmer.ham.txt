subject : hpl meter # 985892 south katy gas unit no . 2 # 1
daren :
during the month of september and october 2000 , gas flowed into hpl ' s
pipeline at the above meter that is owned by duke energy trading and
marketing , llc . prior to september 2000 , the gas was purchased under
contract # 960439646 , and deal # 133196 that expired on 8 / 31 / 2000 . effective
11 / 1 / 2000 , the gas was again purchased from duke under contract # 96021934 ;
deal # 466305 , but this deal expires on 11 / 30 / 2000 .
currently , logistic has september and october 2000 volumes recorded to hpl
strangers gas contract . in order to correct this , hpl logistics needs either
( 1 ) deals # 133196 or # 466305 extended to cover september and october 2000 ,
( 2 ) a new deal to cover september and october 2000 , or ( 3 ) logistics needs
approval to write - off these volumes to unaccounted for gas loss . ( print ,
sign , and return the original to clem cernosek ) .
deal / deal ticket # / customer ( buyer / seller )
or
approval to write - off the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
in addition , since deal # 466305 expires on 11 / 30 / 2000 and gas is still
flowing , logistics needs either ( 1 ) deal # 466305 extended , or ( 2 ) a new deal
to cover december 2000 and any other future months that this production is
flowing into hpl ' s pipeline .
