daren :
on 1 / 25 / 2000 the above meter has recorded flow of 18 mmbtus into hpl ' s
pipeline . currently , the volume is booked to hpl strangers gas contract .
logistics needs approval to write - off this volume to unaccounted for gas .

approval to write - off the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
the above meter was a new meter effective 1 / 1 / 2000 , and therefore , the volume
flowing into hpl was probably caused by putting the meter in service .
thanks , clem
