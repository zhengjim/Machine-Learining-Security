gas accounting is initiating a project to ensure consistent treatment of
physical storage between flash and the gl . to that end , please provide the
book codes and cost of inventory schedules that you have for each of the
physical storage facilities . we will also need what you show as the 1 / 31 / 01
inventory balance for each .
