joanie ,
logistics is waiting to hear from daren on this issue . he will either need
to extend the deal or maybe there should be another deal in place . this
deal 155118 is valid on 1 / 26 / 00 only , but the rest of the volume you are
looking for is scheduled on days 1 / 27 - 1 / 31 . i am sure there is no
pricing on those days .
i will let you know as soon as i hear from them .
