Subject: subject : rankings for source / destination
please forward to logistics in your region . . . . . .
would any of the desks be opposed to enabling unify to default the
destination rankings to the same rankings that are created in the source
rankings . there would still be the ability to change to ranking on the
destination side however , it would not affect the rankings on the source
side . this will save time pathing and prevent the amount of data entry
errors . would you please forward comments to your manager . dave
nommenson is aware that some of us are interested in this and would like to
find out if it would be something worth putting into production .
thanks .
